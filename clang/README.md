# The Checked C clang repo

This repo contains a version of clang that is being modified to support Checked C.  Checked C 
extends C with checking to detect or prevent common programming  errors such as
out-of-bounds memory accesses.  The Checked C specification is available  at the 
[Checked C repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc).

## Compiler source code update

On January 25, 2019, we updated to LLVM/clang sources from January 16, 2019.  If you are building the Checked C clang compiler 
from source code, we suggest you do a clean build by deleting your cmake object directory.

## We are hiring.

We have a position available for a 
[Principal Software Engineer](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/559081/Principal-Software-Engineer) or a
[Senior Software Engineer](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/570339/Senior-Software-Engineer). We are looking for someone wih compiler and programming language implementation experience who is passionate about making software more secure and reliable.

## Trying out Checked C

Programmers are welcome to ``kick the tires'' on Checked C as it is being implemented.
We have pre-built compiler installers for Windows available for download on the
[release page](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/releases).
For other platforms, you will have to build your own copy of the compiler.  For directions on how to do this, see
the [Checked C clang wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki).   The compiler user manual is [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki/Checked-C-clang-user-manual).
For more information on Checked C and pointers to example code, see our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/wiki).
