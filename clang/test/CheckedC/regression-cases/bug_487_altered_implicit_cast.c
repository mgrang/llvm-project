// The TreeTransform code may alter an implicit cast expression returned by a
// Transform method.  It assumes that they have been regenerated by semantic
// checking.  We substitute argument expressions into bounds expressions at
// calls in SemaBounds using a TreeTransform.  When the argument
// expression was an implicit cast, it was altered by the TreeTransform.  The 
// argument expression is used elsewhere, so that is incorrect.  This 
// triggered an assert in code generation.
