This directory contains clang-implementation specific tests for the Checked C
language extension.

It does not contain language conformance tests for the extension.  Those tests
are stored separately in the Checked C project repository.  If you have
placed the Checked C repo at llvm\projects\checkedc-wrapper\checkedc,
the language conformance tests are in the tests subdirectory of the checkedc
directory.
